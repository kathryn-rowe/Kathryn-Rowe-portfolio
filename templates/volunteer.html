        by Kate Rowe<br>

        On February 10th, the CNPS North Coast chapter’s program will feature information about CNPS’ rare plant program. If you’re interested in learning more about California’s rare native plants, I suggest joining us in February and exploring information found on Calflora.org. An online database of California plants, Calflora can be a great resource for information about rare, native, and naturalized vascular plants (Figure 1).<br><br>
        To begin using Calflora, consider registering. This is a free service that allows you to contribute observations to the database. Not only will this help CNPS better understand plant distribution throughout the state, information entered about rare plants will greatly help CNPS’ rare plant program by providing information about population sizes and verifying whether or not a species is still found at a particular location.<br><br>
        If you’re looking just to find general details about a plant, Calflora’s searching capabilities are vast. Enter the name of the plant you’d like to learn more about (common, scientific, or just part of the name), and hit search. The search results show a distribution map, identification photographs, whether or not the plant is included in the CNPS Inventory of Rare and Endangered plants, and much more.<br><br>
        You can also search for “Monocot” in the lifeform “Tree” found in “Humboldt” county. Can you guess what species this is (guess: non-native)? How many “Gymnosperm” in the lifeform “Shrub” are found in “Humboldt”?<br><br>
        Calflora also searches by location, and returns a list of plants that grow in a particular area. After clicking on “What Grows Here?” on the Calflora homepage, you will be directed to the “What Grows Here?” tool. In Figure 2, I drew a polygon around my address and learned I should be able to find 142 plants around my home.<br><br>
        Advanced searching options are available through Calflora that allow you to customize your particular inquiry, and does not require a steep learning curve. I encourage you to explore this database, and we’ll see you February 10th!<br><br>

        by Kate Rowe<br>
        <i>published in <a href="http://yournec.org/econews/junjul2016">EcoNews June/July 2016,</a> pg. 23</i><br>
        As we welcome the beginning of this winter’s rain, we need to be mindful that we are still in a drought. While planning for the upcoming planting season, consider replacing water-guzzling lawns with drought tolerant plants. Local landowner’s can effectively reduce their water footprint by making this switch, and available state rebates help hinder the cost. Under California’s 2015 Turf Replacement Initiative, single-family households can apply for up to $2,000 in rebates to replace their turf with a drought-tolerant landscape. With the goal of removing 10 million square feet of turf, the state is offering these $2 per square foot rebates on a first-come, first serve basis. To start, applications are (only) available online and require photos, measurements, and a copy of a recent water or energy bill. And then like most good things in life, you wait a couple of weeks for a response. After approval, you have four months to complete the conversion before you have to submit five “after” photos of your project. Rebates will be sent 8 – 10 weeks post-completion.  If you rely on these rebates to make this project feasible, wait for that initial response first. Good news if you rent or lease -- you are still eligible for this program if you obtain permission from the landowner.<br><br>
        This process appears straightforward and simple, and provides an opportunity to learn more about choosing which native, drought-tolerant plants have the highest likelihood of survival in your yard. Native plants can require little water or care once planted in an appropriate setting, but understanding what will work best can sometimes require more planning. CNPS’s website (cnps.org/cnps/grownative/lawn) provides helpful tools for replacing your lawn and the North Coast’s chapter website has great information about locally found plants (northcoastcnps.org).
