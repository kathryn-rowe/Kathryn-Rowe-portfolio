    <div class="row" id="photo-row">
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8 col-lg-8">I'm a biologist turned Software Engineer with a tendency towards environmental activism. Prior to becoming a software engineer, I could be found tromping around the woods looking for birds and salmon. I've hootied for Northern Spotted Owls in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, put bands on songbirds in Massachusettes, and snorkeled for salmon down the Mattole River.

        Working for environmental organizations has grounded me in a field that I’m passionate about and shown me the barriers that community-based nonprofits face to realize their projects. I enjoy developing creative solutions for small-budget, fast-paced environmental organizations. 

        As an AmeriCorps for the Salmon River Restoration Council, I managed a US Forest Service grant to remove noxious weeds and collect native grass seed. I used ArcGIS as a tool to translate this large-scale project into achievable tasks by strategically fragmenting the basin into smaller areas. I later went onto graduate school and began working with Python to automate spatial analysis problems. 

        I want to develop the tools to expand public outreach, data collection, and community support.
