        That Time I Hooted for Owls in 2008<br>
    </div>

    <div class="row" id="photo-row">

        <h3>Back when blogging was just gaining popularity, I decided to record some of my new jobs and adventures. I had just taken a seasonal position in remote Northern California to hoot for the Northern Spotted Owl. I was fresh out of college, soon be driving from Minnesota to California, and spending 3 months in the woods.</h3><br><br>

        &#10043; <i>Warning: My excitement and sense of awe are hard to overlook in the following posts:</i><br><br>

        <b>Yo-se-mite</b><br><br>

        &#10043; <i>note: This job was for a University of Washington Department of Conservation Biology project. Team responsibilites included finding Spotted Owls, recording their locations and behaviors, and collecting fecal samples. I was on the Shasta-Trinity Crew based in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. The other crew, Mendo, was based in the Mendocino National Forest.</i><br><br>

        After leaving Covelo after experiments (or enduro’s as we call them), Melissa and I headed down to Yosemite National Park. The first day we took our time getting out of Covelo, so we didn’t get too far. We actually ended up in Stockton, Ca which is just past Sacremento. There we did our stops in civilization: Target run, Trader Joe’s, etc. While we were poking around in town, we were like “I wonder when Sex and the City movie comes out” and then all of a sudden on NPR they said he came out that night. That meant that we couldn’t pass through a town that had a movie theater without stopping and seeing it. So we did after we got sushi and watching Christian Softball in a random park. By the time we got out of Stockton on our way to look for a campsite it was around 1am. We were driving and driving and finally we found something. We just pulled in and decided to sleep in the car so we could wake up and get the hell out of dodge first thing in the morning. Have I mentioned how much I love my Subaru (aka Aurora)? It’s so comfortable! Anyways, we woke up after a peaceful night of sleep and wanted to get out. Problem is we had to go by a fee collection area. We had to spend $20 for sleeping maybe 6hours in my car. Pure crap. I guess that is what you get when you want to camp by a reservoir, which they called a lake. Water here is a precious commodity. Thankfully that was the most money we spent the whole week for “lodging.” After heading out, we made it to Yosemite not too much longer after that. Busy busy busy. The views were amazing but the Valley was crazy crowded and confusing. Melissa and I decided to try and get settled and make plans for what we were going to do there. We headed to the Wilderness Headquarters and tried to make a game plan for getting away from all the turons and into the wilderness. The ranger there was NOT helpful and couldn’t give us suggestions on where to go. Thank god we talked to Jay and Eric before we left and got some tips on what to see. Since it was a weekend, we couldn’t hike to where we wanted right away but we made a plan to go out to Mount Star King and then back over to Cloud’s Rest and Half Dome the next day. And then we learned about the bears. The bears in Yosemite are like no other bears. You can’t leave any food or scented items in your car because the bears will break your windows to get to it. They will then eat everything and scat all over. If you go out hiking you also have to bring a bear canister and plan your food accordingly so it will fit into to this dang contraption. Melissa and I were unaware of this little bear problem so the previous day we had gone to Trader Joe’s and stocked up on groceries. We had also been living out of my car during our time in Covelo so there was lotion, bug sprays, food, chapsticks and anything else you can think of hidden and stockpiled in my car. After stopping at the John Muir Gallery, we made our way to a parking lot and spent the rest of the afternoon and into the evening planning, eating and getting our shit together for our trip into the wilderness.<br><br>

        That night we stayed at backpacker’s campground (which we never would have found if it weren’t for a nice German that ran up to us and told us where to go). We slept in and around noonish we headed out. And by heading out I mean heading up. Straight up out of the valley. We were doing switchbacks the entire day with our big packs on. This is also the point where I want to mention how badass Melissa is and how I want to be like her when I grow up. She is one tough cookie! We finally made it to the top around six, made supper and passed out. The next morning I was lucky enough to wake up during the morning chorus and I’m pretty sure I heard a Grey Owl. It’s pretty awesome because they are really rare. Yeah! Anyways, I went back to sleep and then we both slept in again. I woke up to terrible pain in my hips and one of them swollen to where it looked like I had a hotdog coming out of my side. Glancing at the map, we realized that we would be doing more switchbacks that day and I knew I would be in some serious pain. I had to bow down and suggest we head out. Straight down on a trail where there were steep steps that were completely wet from the waterfalls. Oh and we saw a turon peeing on the trail. Who does that?! The new plan: instead of making it to Cloud’s Rest and Half Dome, we were going to take Eric’s suggestion and catch the sunset on Sentinel dome. Problem is there were no campsites near that part of the park. When we went to drop off our bear canisters, we talked to another Ranger who was super cool and suggested to sleep by Sentinel Dome anyways because they were short staffed at the moment. AWESOME! We collected all our food out of the bear lockers we had put them in before we went into the wilderness and then drove 1/2hour to Sentinel dome where we then hiked a mile to the top of the dome. Best mile hike ever. The view from the top was spectacular- 360* with a sunset. It was indescribable. There were also not a lot of people up there: some family with a lot of kids, people in their 30’s/40’s, an older couple that was obviously still in love. The sun set and we made our way back to the car, getting lost a liitle in the dark on the way back. We ended up finding a trailhead parking lot and slept in Aurora again. In the morning, we got up early this time for sunrise at Glacier Point. This experience was almost just like the night previous: beautiful, high up, not a lot of people. Certainly worth the loss of sleep if we didn’t end up leaving at daylight and going back to bed. Our next plan was head down and out of Yosemite, stopping at Mariposa Grove to see the Giant Seqouias. We hiked around there for awhile and learned about these magnificent trees. The area was burned but seeing a 2,000year old tree takes your breath away.<br><br>

        My time in Yosemite was well worth the craziness of crowds because the views were absolutely spectacular. Go if you get the chance!<br><br>

        *wait for this: While I was starting to write this blog, some guy walked into the coffee shop asking who’s car is from WI. I piped up and said that it was mine. He then proceeded to walk over and asked where in WI. I did the usual “you’re not going to know, but Luck.” Sure enough, he did. He’s even lived there and he has family from the area (Jason and Keith Anderson). We talked for awhile about home: I had to inform him about Gary DeNucci (they used to be friends) and we talked about the same places we knew. It’s such a small world. FYI: he’s name is Fred Allan in case you know him. He now lives in Key West in a sailboat…seriously. He's also going to be here all summer. It's crazy to think there are two Luckinites living in Hayfork, CA. **and now to make another break within this break. I heard another guy talking after I was done having a conversation with Fred. He was conversing with the owner of the coffee shop I am at right now. The couple who owns the coffee shop, Northern Delights, is really, really nice. Dennis is from Ireland and his wife is from Finland. Anyways, the guys that was talking to Dennis’s wife asked where she was from and he was like “oh, do you know where Finlandia University is.” After they were done talking, I piped up again and was like “you know where FU is?” He was like “yeah” and I was like “one of my good friend’s dad was the president of FU.” Anyways, we got to talking and he actually has spent a lot of time in Hurley, WI. We also talked about conspiracy theories and hitchhiking. So in conclusion within one hour’s time I’ve meet random guys I have a connection with. The people I have meet here are some of the coolest, most random and nicest people I have ever met. I LOVE HAYFORK!** <br><br>

        After leaving Yosemite, Melissa and I wanted to take a decompression night to recover from people. We found a reservoir that looked like it had a lot of campgrounds around it just outside the park but after driving all along the north side, we came to realize the sites were only on the south side of the lake. And they were expensive. So we decided to drive onto the nearby National Forest land and camp there because it’s free. We found a nice little area to camp and hung out there all night. It was really nice and quite. I actually stayed up past dark (whoa!) and read my book. It was a little scary, though, because I thought I heard Bigfoot a couple of times. The next morning, we continued to drive and made it to King’s Canyon National Park. BEAUTIFUL. It was like a larger version of the Black Canyon in Colorado. We drove to the bottom, stopping to see waterfalls and had a picnic. The visitor center was also pretty sweet because it was all about conservation and education. Sequoias National Park is connected to King’s so we headed down there. We got there a little later and realized again that we didn’t know where we were going to sleep that night. After asking how much campsites were ($16- no thank you!), we decided to go to a picnic area to have dinner and discuss our options before sunset. We found a spot on the map that had a picnic table symbol but when we arrived, there was only one picnic table that was broken and in the parking lot. Not exactly what we were picturing. We also saw all these gov’t vehicles parked there and after coming from Yosemite where the Park Rangers were strict, we were a little nervous. As we cooked up our refried beans and rice for our delicious burritos, we heard talking coming from the woods. All of a sudden a group of 15-20 people walked into the parking lot, past us and to the gov’t vehicles. From what we could see there were a couple of Park Rangers and the rest were people our age: interns in training. Here’s the best thing about it though- nobody said anything to us. No hi. Nothing. After the group drove off and away, Melissa and I figured that Sequoias National Park is pretty lax so we should just stay in the parking lot of where we wanted to be in the morning. And we did. I’ll never forget waking up in my car that night when it was pitch dark. I looked out the window to stars and Giant Sequoias and remember thinking “Now this is what being alive is all about.”<br><br>
        
        The next morning Melissa awoke, sat up and said “There’s a Park Ranger. NO JOKE!” We quickly went into motion and threw our sleeping bags off, put on our shoes and tried to somehow look like we just got there and were getting ready to hike. The Ranger just drove by, barely slowing down to investigate our car. It was awesome. Since we already had our gear on pretty much, we decided to just get up and hike. I have officially seen the largest living thing on earth: a giant sequoia named General Sherman. This thing was so massive that your brain has a hard time grasping how huge it is. All the signs have to put it into perspective by saying it’s bigger as the Statue of Liberty and has been around since before Jesus. Awesome. While we were walking on the trail, an older man came up to us holding to rather large rocks. He told us he was just walking on the trail in front of us, saw a bear and turned around. He asked us if he could walk 50meters behind us so he could still hike the trail but not being alone. Since seeing a bear doesn’t really scare Melissa and I anymore (she’s seen 3 this summer and I’ve seen one) we said SURE! So we just continued walking. After no bear sighting for awhile, the man got a little more comfortable and dropped the rocks. We all got to talking and we found out that he was from Holland, was in the area due to work and got up early so he could take pictures of the deer. He was an incredibly nice man that had a little bit of a hard time understanding us but the conversation was very interesting. Mr. Holland also made me appreciate deer more. It was somewhat ironic because the day before when Melissa and I were in Mariposa Grove (Yosemite), I made a comment about how I didn’t know if it was a good or bad thing that people got so excited to see a deer. It’s great that people love seeing nature and wild animals but since deer are so abundant, that means people don’t get outside that often to see them. Mr. Holland’s excitement, however, really moved me and I actually found myself very excited when we saw some deer through a Giant Sequoias.<br><br>

        When we left Sequoias National Park, it was already Thursday and we had to be back to Hayfork on Saturday at 4pm to go out hooting again. Melissa and I also wanted some time to decompress, do laundry and get things in order before we started our weird schedule again. Oh and time to shower because we hadn’t in about a week and a half. Oh, nevermind, we took “whore baths” in Fresno on the way to King’s at some gas station that was dirty than us and also in Sequoias after we met Mr. Holland. Believe me, Sequoias was like a 5star resort because the bathroom was clean and there was running water- what!? Yosemite, King’s Canyon and Sequoias National Parks are all on the east side of California and one way to get back to Hayfork would have been to take Hwy 5 up. But we decided that would be too boring and we both had a desire to drive the famous Hwy 1 when we are out here. So that’s what we did, first driving across San Jaquin Valley (sp?) to get some fresh fruit that California has ALL THE TIME. It was delicious. We made it to the coast sometime in the afternoon and a little bit later Santa Cruz. We had been talking early that week that we should stop on the way back to Hayfork in a bigger city to have a “last supper.” We had been eating a lot of PB-J, trader joe’s fixin’s, fruit and just had a craving for a great meal. And where better to do that than a city. We chose to stop in Santa Cruz for a couple of different reasons. One, Laura (another intern) made it sound like it was an awesome place because that is where she is from. Secondly, there is a Patagonia Outlet there…yeah, like I need more stuff from Patagonia ;) And thirdly, it is on the beach. We got into town and after driving in the crowded masses for a little while, we found a Hawaiian restaurant. Good food except for this sushi thing that Melissa got that tasted like vinegar. We left the restaurant and wanted to find the beach, which we did, and along with it surfers. Lots and lots of surfers. People were just walking around with their boards, riding their bikes with their boards attached, hanging out in their vans with their boards on top. It was a surfer Mecca. Melissa and I were chilling out at this spot watching surfers, writing postcards and again trying to figure out where we were going to sleep that night. All of a sudden, we saw this animal amongst the surfers. We were talking about it and trying to decide if it was an otter or a seal when a guy with a little girl on his shoulder piped up and said it was an otter. Melissa continued to talk with him and I was on the phone with Leah who was map-questing how long it took to get back to Hayfork from Santa Cruz. While I was laughing at Leah and her relationship with Randy, her internet connection, I heard the guy (whose name is Paul) offer us his couch to sleep on. He said he’s traveled a lot before and has been in our situation where you don’t know where you are going to sleep in the next few hours. We said we would think about it and give him a call later after he drops his little girl off at her mom’s and runs some errands. We spent the next hour or so discussing our situation, walking along the beach and getting some Ben and Jerry’s. Fire and ice cream on the beach. Wow. We made our decision and said that he seemed cool enough, if we got their and it was sketchy we would leave. So we ended up staying at Paul’s house that night. He ended up being one of the nicest people I’ve ever met: offered us his food, place to stay, shower. He even trusted us enough that he got up early the next morning to go surfing and left us to lock up his house when we left. He was a very cool dude that has (as much as I could figure out from the little amount of conversation we had) traveled around the world surfing and grew up in Santa Cruz. He gave us history of the area and told us cool information about Monterey Bay. I’m so happy we met him. Melissa and I have now decided that we are going to go back to visit Paul and become surfer chicks. It’s a done deal.<br><br>

        The next morning, Melissa and I left Paul’s house that was only a couple of blocks from the ocean and headed out (first stopping at a Natti food’s store, the Pat Outlet and a coffee shop). We drove up Hwy 1 all day and boy was it beautiful. And curvy. We only stopped a couple of times for gas and also to enjoy the view of the ocean with our lunch. While eating the remainder of our PB&J, some guy opened up his truck door and said, “I bet I can play a song for you that you’ll love and have no idea who it is.” He was right. So we just chilled by the ocean, eating lunch and listening to some great music that some random guy was playing for us. It was awesome.<br><br>

        After a quick bit to eat in Fort Bragg (which was something I didn’t order and actually ended up making me sick), we arrived in Hayfork around 2am on Saturday morning. This trip was one I will never forget: spectacular sceneries, amazing people, crazy situations and all unbelievable.<br><br>

        <b>Happy first day of Summer, Everyone!!!!</b><br><br>

        This summer is flying by and there are so many memories I am going to take with me in August. One of them is of the weekend in Mendo when the forest was on fire.<br><br>

        After coming back to Hayfork after our week off and hooting for only a couple of nights, the Shasta crew found out we would be taking a trip to Mendocino National Forest to help out the other half of our crew. What?! Leave Hayfork and Shasta-Trinity National Forest already? Melissa and I were just talking about how great it was to be back in Hayfork after being down in Yosemite, King’s Canyon, and Sequoia National Parks. The Mendo crew, however, needed help finding owls in this one particular area and it was going to be splendid to see everyone again. We arrived at the campsite (Kenny Camp) in the early evening on Wednesday after driving most of the afternoon and stopping for groceries and pizza in Red Bluff. The Mendo crew had already been at Kenny Camp for awhile when we got there so we just joined them and chilled by the fire.<br><br>

        The next day, awaiting our time to go hooting, the crew chilled and chatted about our time spent apart. I also believe there was a killer game of Hearts going on, which lasted much more than a couple of hours. That night, I went out hooting with Aimee. We were driving to our site when we realized there was a lot of smoke in the sky. Hmm… wonder where that was coming from. The smoke wasn’t too strong so we continued to hoot, got a response and eventually found our male. I say eventually because we heard a response, ran down to find the owl, realized the response was coming from the other side of the drainage, hiked back up to the car, drove around to the other side, ran in to find him, and finally hiked out before dark. Since this was Aimee and my only site, we ended up getting back to Kenny Camp early. At 10pm, it was check in time on the Kings [radio]. There was word from Catherine, Shane and Ruben that they heard a response but didn’t think they should stay in the area because of the fire. Yes, the forest was on fire. The next morning, Catherine showed us pictures she had taken of the inferno- a full-blown forest fire. Since I had never experienced a forest fire before, I wasn’t sure if I should have been excited or completely in panic mode. I remember telling Shane my predicament and he said, “Yeah, this is just exciting.” Around 1pm, the smoke actually started blowing into Kenny Camp. In all the commotion and excitement surrounding the fact we were actually in a forest fire, Aimee and Jennifer radioed in to CalFire dispatch to see if we should evacuate. They said it wasn’t necessary because the flames were far enough away and we should be fine. After a little discussion about getting a Kenny Camp Helipad (Jay’s suggestion) and celebrating Laura’s glorious birthday, we continued our work as usual. So to be clear: this was Friday the 13th, Laura’s Birthday and the forest was on fire. Wow.<br><br>

        <div><img border="0" src="./static/images/scat.bmp" alt="scat" width="40%" align="center"></div><br><br>

        Later that night, I went out with Jennifer and had a great night. We first attempted to get to a really close site but because of a massive tree in the road, Jennifer decided to hit up another site. We did a call point from the road, heard nothing and starting to hike in. After our second or third call point, Jennifer heard a response. We ended up finding a male at the tip-top of a huge tree. After watching the male for a little while and realizing there was no way we would get either scat or be able to mouse him, Jennifer went to go find the female. I remember her walking away and then in the faintest voice saying “Oh, there’s the female. She just flew in.” Jennifer continued to mouse the female to see if they were nesting. Four mice and all cached later, we concluded there wasn’t a nest. Dark was settling in so it was time for us to hike up and out. Oddly enough, we were followed by the owls the entire time we hiked out. Even when we got into the car the owl was perched on a branch, staring at us as we drove away. Later, when we were driving a round about way to get to our first attempted site, we heard a four-note from the car. This owl, we soon figured out, was actually Aimee and Ruben’s owl. Since the site we were trying to get to was going to be extremely close to their site, we called it a night and I got to come back to Kenny Camp early again.<br><br>

        <div><img border="0" src="./static/images/map.jpg" alt="map" width="40%" align="center"></div><br><br>

        The next morning, we gathered all our things and headed back to Covelo. Everyone had the next couple of days off and the Shasta group decided to hang out with the Mendo group by the Eel River. That was a good idea because the weather was hot and the river was sweet. We swam all day and just enjoyed our day in Covelo. We all headed out the next afternoon and I’ve been in Hayfork ever since. Just spending time at the coffee shop, swimming in Hayfork Creek, trying to find spottys and enjoying the sweet California life.
